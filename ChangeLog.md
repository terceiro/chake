# 0.80

This release adds support for multiple configuration managers. Chef is now only
one of the options. There is also now support for configuration management with
itamae, and lightweight configuration management tool inspired by Chef, and via
shell commands. This should be mostly transparent to current Chef users, but
new repositories initiatied by chake will use itamae by default.

Other notable changes:

* rake nodes: list configuration manager and format as table
* Chake::Connection: fix handling of stderr
* Rebootstrap nodes when changing config managers
* bootstrap, upload: skip when config manager does not need them

# 0.21.2

* Chake::Backend#run: don't strip leading whitespace

# 0.21.1

* Fix converge when the connection is not already made as root. This bug was
  introduced by the change in the previous release.

# 0.21

* converge, apply: allow removing data from the node JSON attributes

# 0.20

* check: give some feedback by running `sudo echo OK` instead of `sudo true`
* Get rid of global variables
* bin/chake: make rake run one thread for each node
* Chake::Backend: run commands by opening a shell and writing to it
* Document Chake.nodes

# 0.19

* Protect node JSON files from other users

# 0.18

* add console task
* manpage: fix header transformation
* manpage: ignore intermediary .adoc file

# 0.17.1

* manpage: drop ad-hoc handling of `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` (let asciidoctor handle
  it)

# 0.17

* make rsync exclude extra directories who are created as root by chef-solo at
  the server side. This fixes the case where upload phase when the SSH user is
  not root.

# 0.16

* make `run` also capture stderr, for now mixed together with stdout. In the
  future that may be improved for example to print stderr output in red when
  running on a TTY.

# 0.15

* improve text in the parallel execution docs
* add new hook: `connect_common`, which will run before any attempt to connect
  to any node.
* make output of `check` target more explicit about what was tested

# 0.14

* Fix typo in README.md
  * thanks to Luciano Prestes Cavalcanti
* Turn "all hosts" tasks (converge, upload, bootstrap, run, apply) into
  multitasks. This will make them run in parallel.

* Use the Omnibus packages from Chef upstream on platforms where we don't have
  proper Chef packages from the OS official repository.

# 0.12

* Switch manpage build from ronn to asciidoctor
* Add ability to override the Chef configuration file by setting
  `$CHAKE_CHEF_CONFIG` (default: `config.rb`)
* bootstrap: ensure short hostname is in /etc/hosts

# 0.11

* bootstrap: make sure FQDN matches hostname
* Add `rake check` task to check SSH connectivity and sudo setup
* Add tasks to apply a single recipe to nodes: `rake apply[recipe]` and `rake
  apply:$NODE[recipe]`. If `[recipe]` is not passed in the command line, the
  user is prompted for the recipe name.
* run task changed to have the same interface and behavior as the new apply
  task: `rake run[command]`, or `rake run:$NODE[command]`. If `[command]` is
  not passed in the command line, the user is prompted for the command.

# 0.10.2

* Fix check for modified files at the upload phase. Now chake will properly
  avoiding rsync calls when there is no changed files since the latest upload.
* Fix generated RPM spec file. Will now properly build, install, and work under
  both CentOS 7 and Fedora 22+.
* Collect test coverage statistics when running tests.
  * Added dependency on simplecov

# 0.10.1

* actually implement support for custom ports in Node URL's. Despite being
  documented, that didn't actually work until now.

# 0.10

* Add hook functionality. See README/manpage for documentation.
* README.md: a few reviews

# 0.9.1

* fix manpage installation path

# 0.9

* fix build step for obs uploads
* add infrastructure to build and install a manpage
* Add support for a nodes.d/ directory; very useful when dealing with a larger
  amount of nodes.

# 0.8

* gemspec: minor improvements in the long description
* LICENSE.txt: fixed license name
* run: print small message before prompting
* Add history support for the `run` tasks
* Abort `run` tasks if no command is provided

# 0.7

* gemspec: improve summary and description

  $cookbook/files/\*/.
* Allow overriding tmpdir with `$CHAKE_TMPDIR`
* Stop cloud-init from resetting the hostname

# 0.6

* Support a ssh prefix command by setting `$CHAKE_SSH_PREFIX` in the
  environment. For example, `CHAKE_SSH_PREFIX=tsocks` will make all ssh
  invocations as `tocks ssh ...` instead of just `ssh ...`.

# 0.5

* Add a task login:$host that you can use to easily log in to any of your
  hosts.

# 0.4.3

* When running remote commands as root, run `sudo COMMAND` directly instead of
  `sudo sh -c "COMMAND"`. Under over-restrictive sudo setups (i.e. one in which
  you cannot run a shell as root), `sudo sh -c "FOO"` will not be allowed.

# 0.4.2

* tmp/chake: create only when actually needed
* Control nodes files with `$CHAKE_NODES`

# 0.4.1

* Don't always assume the local username as the remote username for SSH
  connections:
  * `user@host`: connect with `user@host`
  * `host`: connect with `host` (username will be obtained by SSH itself from
    either its configuration files or the current username)

# 0.4.0

* Redesign build of RPM package
* Output of command run on nodes is now aligned
* Change storage of temporary files from .tmp to tmp/chake
* The JSON node attributes files generated in tmp/chake are not readable

  environment variable

* update test suite to use new rspec syntax instead the old one which is
  obsolete in rspec 3.
  * Thanks to Athos Ribeiro.
